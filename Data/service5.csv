Good case, Excellent value.;noturgent
Great for the jawbone.;noturgent
Tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutes.MAJOR PROBLEMS!!;noturgent
The mic is great.;noturgent
I have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume.;noturgent
If you have several dozen or several hundred contacts, then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one.;noturgent
If you are Razr owner...you must have this!;noturgent
Needless to say, I wasted my money.;noturgent
What a waste of money and time!.;noturgent
And the sound quality is great.;noturgent
He was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery.;noturgent
If the two were seperated by a mere 5+ ft I started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset.;noturgent
Very good quality though;noturgent
"The design is very odd, as the ear ""clip"" is not very comfortable at all.";noturgent
Highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone.;noturgent
I advise EVERYONE DO NOT BE FOOLED!;noturgent
So Far So Good!;noturgent
Works great!;noturgent
It clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last;noturgent
I went on Motorola's website and followed all directions, but could not get it to pair again.;noturgent
I bought this to use with my Kindle Fire and absolutely loved it!;noturgent
The commercials are the most misleading.;noturgent
I have yet to run this new battery below two bars and that's three days without charging.;noturgent
I bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery.;noturgent
Great Pocket PC / phone combination.;noturgent
I've owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that it's the best mobile phone I've had.;noturgent
I didn't think that the instructions provided were helpful to me.;noturgent
People couldnt hear me talk and I had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone.;noturgent
Doesn't hold charge.;noturgent
This is a simple little phone to use, but the breakage is unacceptible.;noturgent
This product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive.;noturgent
It is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed.;noturgent
I have two more years left in this contract and I hate this phone.;noturgent
Car charger as well as AC charger are included to make sure you never run out of juice.Highy recommended;noturgent
You need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phone.Battery life is short.;noturgent
It has kept up very well.;noturgent
Poor Talk Time Performance.;noturgent
The case is great and works fine with the 680.;noturgent
worthless product.;noturgent
It has a great camera thats 2MP, and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality.;noturgent
I was not impressed by this product.;noturgent
Nice headset priced right.;noturgent
I only hear garbage for audio.;noturgent
Excellent bluetooth headset.;noturgent
It has all the features I want;noturgent
Who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery?.;noturgent
AFTER ARGUING WITH VERIZON REGARDING THE DROPPED CALLS WE RETURNED THE PHONES AFTER TWO DAYS.;noturgent
This case seems well made.;noturgent
Disappointed with battery.;noturgent
Not loud enough and doesn't turn on like it should.;noturgent
good protection and does not make phone too bulky.;noturgent
A usable keyboard actually turns a PDA into a real-world useful machine instead of just a neat gadget.;noturgent
This phone is pretty sturdy and I've never had any large problems with it.;noturgent
I love this thing!;noturgent
Everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price i.e.;noturgent
VERY DISAPPOINTED.;noturgent
I even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great!;noturgent
I have been very happy with the 510 and have had NO complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end.;noturgent
The buttons for on and off are bad.;noturgent
Essentially you can forget Microsoft's tech support.;noturgent
I really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice, elegant and cool.;noturgent
These headphones were a great find - and I think they are perhaps the best purchase I've made in the last several years - seriously.;noturgent
Buy a different phone - but not this.;noturgent
You have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly.;noturgent
The one big drawback of the MP3 player is that the buttons on the phone's front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds.;noturgent
A week later after I activated it, it suddenly died.;noturgent
It feels more comfortable than most headsets because I wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes.;noturgent
Great for iPODs too.;noturgent
This device is great in several situations:1.);noturgent
Mic Doesn't work.;noturgent
Even in my BMW 3 series which is fairly quiet, I have trouble hearing what the other person is saying.;noturgent
Great choice!;noturgent
Nice docking station for home or work.;noturgent
This is a beautiful phone.;noturgent
Love this product.;noturgent
Do Not Buy for D807...wrongly advertised for D807.;noturgent
This is a great little item.;noturgent
I love this phone , It is very handy and has a lot of features .;noturgent
I purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working!!!!!!!!!;noturgent
I wear it everyday and it holds up very well.;noturgent
Not a good bargain;noturgent
Well packaged, arrived on time, and works as intended.;noturgent
The battery runs down quickly.;noturgent
This item worked great, but it broke after 6 months of use.;noturgent
The headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them.;noturgent
This phone works great.;noturgent
The construction of the headsets is poor.;noturgent
Product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and Boy was it cheaper!;noturgent
The phone loads super!;noturgent
For a product that costs as much as this one does, I expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does.;noturgent
Made very sturdy.;noturgent
Worked great!.;noturgent
The ear buds only play music in one ear.;noturgent
Dont waste your money...;noturgent
Will order from them again!;noturgent
If you plan to use this in a car forget about it.;noturgent
I found this product to be waaay too big.;noturgent
Best I've found so far .... I've tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality (for both me and the listener) as well as ease of using.;noturgent
I'm very disappointed with my decision.;noturgent
Integrated seamlessly with the Motorola RAZR phone.;noturgent
Buyer Beware, you could flush money right down the toilet.;noturgent
Definitely a bargain.;noturgent
The price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase.;noturgent
I received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger.;noturgent
Pros:-Good camera - very nice pictures , also has cool styles like black and white, and more.;noturgent
That's a huge design flaw (unless I'm not using it correctly, which I don't think is the case).;noturgent
I love my 350 headset.. My Jabra350 bluetooth headset is great, the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit.;noturgent
I purchased this for the car charger and it does not work.;noturgent
Sound quality on both end is excellent, I use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me !2.;noturgent
This phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful.;noturgent
The camera, although rated at an impressive 1.3 megapixels, renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution.;noturgent
Great product, fast shipping!.;noturgent
Absolutely great.;noturgent
The keyboard is a nice compromise between a full QWERTY and the basic cell phone number keypad.;noturgent
i got this phone around the end of may and i'm completely unhappy with it.;noturgent
It is very comfortable on the ear.;noturgent
It has been a winner for us.;noturgent
Setup couldn't have been simpler.;noturgent
I've tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this Jabra one is the first one I've found that fits my ear comfortably.;noturgent
Could not get strong enough signal.;noturgent
Iam very pleased with my purchase.;noturgent
Bad Quality.;noturgent
Gets the job done.;noturgent
Great audio!.;noturgent
Basically the service was very bad.;noturgent
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger!.;noturgent
I've only had my bluetooth for a few weeks, but I really like it.;noturgent
The BT headset was such a disappoinment.;noturgent
It is so small and you don't even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it.;noturgent
The accompanied software is almost brilliant.;noturgent
Headset works great & was packaged nicely to avoid any damage.;noturgent
I definitly recommend!!;noturgent
Buyer--Be Very Careful!!!!!;noturgent
The majority of the Logitech earbud headsets failed.;noturgent
Very good stuff for the price.;noturgent
My headset works just peachy-keen.;noturgent
In my house I was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement.;noturgent
Voice recognition is tremendous!;noturgent
What a waste.;noturgent
During several different 2 minute calls, I experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars.;noturgent
I was not happy with this item.;noturgent
very disappointed.;noturgent
The phone takes FOREVER to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally.;noturgent
I got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and I'm glad I did.;noturgent
What a waste of time!;noturgent
Its reception is very very poor.;noturgent
Items stated as included from the description ARE NOT INCLUDED.;noturgent
After 3 months, screen just went black all of a sudden.;noturgent
I Was Hoping for More.;noturgent
Audio Quality is poor, very poor.;noturgent
I had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 Blackberry Curve!;noturgent
I know that sounds funny, but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldn't work well.Well, this one works great.;noturgent
I've bought $5 wired headphones that sound better than these.;noturgent
This phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used.;noturgent
Nice quality build, unlike some cheap s*** out there.;noturgent
This item is fantastic and works perfectly!;noturgent
And I just love the colors!;noturgent
W810i is just SUPERB.;noturgent
All I can do is whine on the Internet, so here it goes.The more I use the thing the less I like it.;noturgent
Great charger.;noturgent
This is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate.;noturgent
"Works like a charm; it work the same as the one I got with the phone.";noturgent
I still maintain that monkeys shouldn't make headphones, we just obviously don't share enough DNA to copy the design over to humans.;noturgent
Great Value.;noturgent
Doesn't work at all.. I bougth it for my L7c and its not working.;noturgent
The look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear, with great graphics.;noturgent
doesn't last long.;noturgent
One thing I hate is the mode set button at the side.;noturgent
EXCELLENT SERVICE!!!!!!!!.;noturgent
Thank you for wasting my money.;noturgent
How can that be?The audio quality is poor.;noturgent
The iGo chargers and tips are really great.;noturgent
The file browser offers all the options that one needs.Handsfree is great.;noturgent
Superb Phone on a Great Network.;noturgent
I connected my wife's bluetooth,(Motorola HS850) to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case.;noturgent
I put the latest OS on it (v1.15g), and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while.;noturgent
It only recognizes the Phone as its storage device.;noturgent
If you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations, then this phone is for you!;noturgent
Don't buy this product.;noturgent
I've had this bluetooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear.;noturgent
The sound quality is good and functionality is awesome.;noturgent
I have this phone and it is a thorn in my side, I really abhor it.;noturgent
I recently had problems where I could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected.;noturgent
Incredible!.;noturgent
Design Flaw?.;noturgent
Great phone!.;noturgent
Waste of 13 bucks.;noturgent
But when I check voice mail at night, the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message, and then I'm lost.;noturgent
The replacement died in a few weeks.;noturgent
Any ring tone..Overall good phone to buy..;noturgent
Lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone.;noturgent
I have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more.;noturgent
Not impressed.;noturgent
Light weight, I hardly notice it is there.;noturgent
You'll love how thin it is.;noturgent
Bad Choice.;noturgent
The pleather case doesn't fit.;noturgent
useless phone, simply deaf.;noturgent
The color is even prettier than I thought it would be, and the graphics are incredibly sharp.;noturgent
All in all I think it was a good investment.;noturgent
It makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call.;noturgent
The best electronics of the available FM Transmitters.;noturgent
Battery lasts only a few hours.;noturgent
great headset, very impressed - H500.;noturgent
"The ""1.2"" mega pixel camera, being a part of a phone, is reasonably good.";noturgent
I've had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me.;noturgent
Good transmit audio.;noturgent
We are sending it back.;noturgent
I did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but I learned the lesson that I should not have bought this form online anyway.;noturgent
If you hate earbuds, avoid this phone by all means.;noturgent
Great price also!;noturgent
The range is very decent, I've been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no reception/sound quality issues.;noturgent
fast service.;noturgent
I would highly recommend this.;noturgent
I would recommend this.;noturgent
"I also didn't like the ""on"" button, it felt like it would crack with use.";noturgent
WORST PHONE EVER.;noturgent
I'm still infatuated with this phone.;noturgent
Freezes frequently.;noturgent
It's kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly it's embarrassing how child-like the company is.;noturgent
Simple, lightweight and great fit.;noturgent
All in all, I'd expected a better consumer experience from Motorola.;noturgent
There's a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that I have never experienced before.;noturgent
These are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent.;noturgent
I usually don't like headbands but this one is very lightweight & doesn't mess up my hair.;noturgent
I'm a bit disappointed.;noturgent
I have had this phone for over a year now, and I will tell you, its not that great.;noturgent
I ordered this for sony Ericsson W810i but I think it only worked once (thats when I first used it).;noturgent
The battery is completely useless to me.;noturgent
What a big waste of time.;noturgent
Don't waste your $$$ on this one.;noturgent
Great sound and service.;noturgent
Great sound and service.;noturgent
One of my favorite purchases ever.;noturgent
best bluetooth on the market.;noturgent
I need  now this service !!  I am very rushed!!;urgent
Authentic leather with nice shine and comfort .I recommend you this case !!;noturgent
I was very excited to get this headset because I thought it was really cute.;noturgent
Do not make the same mistake as me.;noturgent
Big Disappointment with calendar sync.;noturgent
the phone was unusable and was not new.;noturgent
Worst Customer Service Ever.;noturgent
No additional ear gels provided, and no instructions whatsoever.;noturgent
It defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset.;noturgent
Worth every penny.;noturgent
Excellent wallet type phone case.;noturgent
Nice headphones for the price and they work great!;noturgent
Internet is excrutiatingly slow.;noturgent
It is very comfortable to wear as well, which is probably the most important aspect about using a case.;noturgent
It's fits like a glove and is strong, secure, and durable.;noturgent
O my gosh the best phone I have ever had.;noturgent
It's very attractive and appears to be of good quality.;noturgent
I love all the features and form factor.;noturgent
This product had a strong rubber/petroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it;noturgent
poor quality and service.;noturgent
The cable looks so thin and flimsy, it is scary.;noturgent
Great Earpiece.;noturgent
Excellent hands free tool.;noturgent
Great for using with your home stereo.;noturgent
Good product - incredible value.;noturgent
Only had this a month but it's worked flawlessly so far.;noturgent
Works great.;noturgent
Absolutel junk.;noturgent
THAT one didn't work either.;noturgent
Battery life is real good.;noturgent
Returned 8 hours later.;noturgent
It's a great item.;noturgent
Don't waste your money!.;noturgent
Love this headset!;noturgent
Not only will it drain your player, but may also potentially fry it.;noturgent
Worked perfectly!;noturgent
Unreliable - I'm giving up.;noturgent
I gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality.;noturgent
Avoid this one if you can.;noturgent
Reversible plug works great.;noturgent
I wasted my little money with this earpiece.;noturgent
Very good phone.;noturgent
You have been deceptive and fraud i will sue you!!;noturgent
Best of all is the rotating feature, very helpful.;noturgent
Comfort for our whole family.;noturgent
Good product, good seller.;noturgent
I love this bluetooth!;noturgent
First of all, it doesn't wear well.;noturgent
I am very impressed with this headset from Plantronics.;noturgent
I got it because it was so small and adorable.;noturgent
Great phone!.;noturgent
I wouldn't recommend buying this product.;noturgent
Piece of Junk.;noturgent
Poorly construct hinge.;noturgent
This item is great, installed it, let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems;noturgent
Great Phone.;noturgent
Don't buy it.;noturgent
Excellent Phone.;noturgent
if you do not change the service I will not recommend your product;noturgent
DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PHONE.;noturgent
The voice recognition thru the handset is excellent.;noturgent
This is hands down the best phone I've ever had.;noturgent
Works great, when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen.;noturgent
This one works and was priced right.;noturgent
Customer service was terrible.;noturgent
Battery life still not long enough in Motorola Razor V3i.;noturgent
Sending it back.;noturgent
Now I know that I made a wise decision.;noturgent
Someone shouldve invented this sooner.;noturgent
Good price.;noturgent
Everything worked on the first try.The device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good.;noturgent
I received it quickly and it works great!!;noturgent
Has been working great.;noturgent
As many people complained, I found this headset's microphone was very weak.;noturgent
My 5-year old Nokia 2160 from Tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this.;noturgent
They do not care about the consumer one bit.;noturgent
This is a good battery, and it got here really fast.;noturgent
The instruction manual is lacking.;noturgent
Also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case.;noturgent
Phone now holds charge like it did when it was new.;noturgent
The battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena.;noturgent
It's uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone (Razr) or with my previous wired headset (that plugged into an LG).;noturgent
We have gotten a lot of compliments on it.;noturgent
This is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving.;noturgent
I want my money back.;noturgent
I love this device.;noturgent
I am also very happy with the price.;noturgent
I ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately.;noturgent
The Ngage is still lacking in earbuds.;noturgent
I was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem.;noturgent
I have 2-3 bars on my cell phone when I am home, but you cant not hear anything.;noturgent
good item, low price.;noturgent
However-the ringtones are not the best, and neither are the games.;noturgent
The plug did not work very well.;noturgent
AMAZON SUCKS.;noturgent
Rip off---- Over charge shipping.;noturgent
VERY comfortable.;noturgent
The battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago.;noturgent
The reception is excellent!;noturgent
It fits comfortably in either ear, the sound is clear and loud, and the charge lasts a couple of days.;noturgent
very clear, quality sound and you don't have to mess with the sound on your iPod since you have the sound buttons on the headset.;noturgent
 long lasting battery (you don't have to recharge it as frequently as some of the flip phones);noturgent
Obviously there is a problem with the adhesive.;noturgent
Very disappointing.;noturgent
It was an inexpensive piece, but I would still have expected better quality.;noturgent
It is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after I bought it.;noturgent
Excellent sound quality.;noturgent
Was not happy.;noturgent
A PIECE OF JUNK THAT BROKE AFTER BEING ON MY PHONE FOR 2 DAYS!!!;noturgent
New Battery works great in phone.;noturgent
Worst customer service.;noturgent
I've dropped my phone more times than I can say, even on concrete and my phone is still great (knock on wood!).;noturgent
Reception is terrible and full of static.;noturgent
Good audio quality.;noturgent
This little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier.;noturgent
I was sitting in my vehicle, with the cradle on my belt, and the headset lost signal.;noturgent
Were JERKS on the phone.;noturgent
Works like a charm.. Works as advertised.;noturgent
Comfortable, Nice Range, Good Battery Life.;noturgent
Their network coverage in Los Angeles is horrible.;noturgent
Excellent starter wireless headset.;noturgent
The loudspeaker option is great, the bumpers with the lights is very ... appealing.;noturgent
The only thing that I think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset.;noturgent
First off the reception sucks, I have never had more than 2 bars, ever.;noturgent
The phone gets EXTREMELY HOT!;noturgent
The microphone also works well, but (according to people I have called) it applifies everything.;noturgent
Nice design and quality.;noturgent
Also, if your phone is dropped, this case is not going to save it, specially when dropped face down.;noturgent
It is light, easy to use, and has very clear reception and transmission.;noturgent
bad fit, way too big.;noturgent
It definitely was not as good as my S11.;noturgent
Waste of money.;noturgent
I had ordered a motorola data cable, got a very well finished and working product.;noturgent
Love This Phone.;noturgent
I was looking for this headset for a long time and now that I've got it I couldn't be happier.;noturgent
I'll be drivng along, and my headset starts ringing for no reason.;noturgent
Display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year.;noturgent
Battery life is also great!;noturgent
The worst phone I've ever had.... Only had it for a few months.;noturgent
Not a good item.. It worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player.;noturgent
This is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if I try to push the ear plug into my ear.;noturgent
Protects the phone on all sides.;noturgent
This is a VERY average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network.;noturgent
Clear Skype Calls, Long Battery Life, Long Range.;noturgent
Soyo technology sucks.;noturgent
Great Hands Free Device.;noturgent
you can even take self portraits with the outside (exterior) display, very cool.;noturgent
Same problem as others have mentioned.;noturgent
After trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well.;noturgent
Magical Help.;noturgent
The worst piece of crap ever along with the Verizon customer service.;noturgent
Poor sound quality.;noturgent
The best phone in market :).;noturgent
It worked very well.;noturgent
The company shipped my product very promptly and it works well.;noturgent
Exactly what I wanted.;noturgent
This is a great deal.;noturgent
Excellent product, I am very satisfied with the purchase.;noturgent
I highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try.;noturgent
Better than you'd expect.;noturgent
Using all earpieces, left or right, this thing will not stay on my ear.;noturgent
Great product and price.;noturgent
Sounds good reasonably priced and effective, Its that simple !;noturgent
what a disappointment;noturgent
Very prompt service.;noturgent
Excellent product for the price.;noturgent
Very pleased with this headset.;noturgent
don't waste your money and time.;noturgent
I especially love the long battery life.;noturgent
It's so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers, car chargers, cradles, headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out.;noturgent
Works great.;noturgent
Plantronics Bluetooth Excelent Buy.;noturgent
I came over from Verizon because singulair has nicer cell phones.... the first thing I noticed was the really bad service.;noturgent
I'll be looking for a new earpiece.;noturgent
I'll be looking for a new earpiece.Jawbone Era is awesome too!;noturgent
We received a WHITE colored battery that goes DEAD after a couple hours THe original used to last a week - but still lasts longer than the replacement;noturgent
After a year the battery went completely dead on my headset.;noturgent
I have used several phone in two years, but this one is the best.;noturgent
An Awesome New Look For Fall 2000!.;noturgent
This is the first phone I've had that has been so cheaply made.;noturgent
Att is not clear, sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk.;noturgent
Price is good too.;noturgent
The plastic breaks really easy on this clip.;noturgent
Don't make the same mistake I did.;noturgent
Oh and I forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone.;noturgent
I'm using it with an iriver SPINN (with case) and it fits fine.;noturgent
Also the area where my unit broke).- I'm not too fond of the magnetic strap.;noturgent
Overall, I am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception.;noturgent
every thing on phone work perfectly, she like it.;noturgent
Another note about this phone's appearance is that it really looks rather bland, especially in the all black model.;noturgent
IT'S REALLY EASY.;noturgent
My Sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect.;noturgent
Fantastic earphones.;noturgent
It finds my cell phone right away when I enter the car.;noturgent
Low Quality;noturgent
 What is that !! I am very angry about your service!! You must change the quality of your service!!;noturgent
But it does get better reception and clarity than any phone I've had before.;noturgent
Warning - Stay away.;noturgent
I wish I could return the unit and get back my money.;noturgent
Awsome Device Works Great!!.;noturgent
I used to talk on it for 1 - 1 1/2 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying.;noturgent
If you don't find it, too bad, as again the unit comes with one earpad only.I would not recommend this to anyone.;noturgent
Very Displeased.;noturgent
I might have gotten a defect, but I would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone.;noturgent
They made this case too small and is very difficult to install.;noturgent
Restored my phone to like new performance.;noturgent
I would recommend purchasing the Jabra JX-10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my Moto Q, go figure.;noturgent
I searched the Internet, and found this one to be the best value.;noturgent
Does not fit.;noturgent
Very happy with this product.;noturgent
The screen size is big, key pad lit well enough, and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone.;noturgent
There's really nothing bad I can say about this headset.;noturgent
i'm glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find, it wasn't high priced.;noturgent
Portable and it works.;noturgent
My colleague & I now get great reception.A little expensive, but performance is great.;noturgent
I even fully charged it before I went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wi-fi and noticed that it only had 20 % left in the morning.;noturgent
I've also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which I always turn it on and then off again.;noturgent
Not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses.;noturgent
Timely shipment and quality product.;noturgent
Nice solid keyboard.;noturgent
Very well made and fits my Surefire GX2 perfectly.;noturgent
Horrible phone.;noturgent
BT50 battery junk!.;noturgent
We would recommend these to others.;noturgent
Cant get the software to work with my computer.;noturgent
Disappointed!.;noturgent
poor voice clarity.;noturgent
The battery works great!;noturgent
No buyers remorse on this one!.;noturgent
Very disappointed in Accessory One.;noturgent
I find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers.;noturgent
"Looks great and is strong.""";noturgent
I have had TMobile service for 2 or 3 years now, and I am pretty happy with it.;noturgent
The update procedure is difficult and cumbersome.;noturgent
Disappointment.. I hate anything that goes in my ear.;noturgent
Great software for Motorolas.;noturgent
The delivery was on time.;noturgent
Very easy to use.;noturgent
Uncomfortable In the Ear, Don't use with LG VX9900 (EnV).;noturgent
The volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown.;noturgent
It holds a charge for a long time, is reasonably comfortable under long-wearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous.;noturgent
I'd like to return it.;noturgent
The keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough I don't expect any problems.;noturgent
your service is very slow !! despite the fact that I said that I am very rushed;urgent
Verizon's bills, however, are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple.;noturgent
After charging overnight, these batteries work great.;noturgent
You won't regret it!;noturgent
I love this phone!.;noturgent
A Disappointment.;noturgent
Its not user friendly.;noturgent
Unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect.;noturgent
Then I exchanged for the same phone, even that had the same problem.;noturgent
This results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute.;noturgent
This PDA rocks.;noturgent
It is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtop/camera/cellphone, and excels in those roles.;noturgent
I would definitely recommend the Jabra BT250v for those who are looking for comfort, clarity and a great price!;noturgent
I had Verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service.;noturgent
Pretty piece of junk.;noturgent
Plug was the wrong size.;noturgent
Works as described.;noturgent
Save your money.... I've had this item for 11 months now.;noturgent
Bad Purchase.;noturgent
WELL IM SATISFIED.;noturgent
The bose noise cancelling is amazing, which is very important for a NYC commuter.;noturgent
This battery is an excellent bargain!;noturgent
Defective crap.;noturgent
I would have given no star if I was able.;noturgent
I wear glasses and it fits fine with them.;noturgent
The sound quality for the device is unacceptable.Unless you are in a really quiet area, you almost hear nothing.;noturgent
I would not recommend this item to anyone.;noturgent
The holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad.;noturgent
great...no problems at all!.;noturgent
As an earlier review noted, plug in this charger and nothing happens.;noturgent
This frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching.;noturgent
You never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not.;noturgent
The sound is clear and the people I talk to on it are amazed at the quality too.;noturgent
I got the aluminum case for my new Palm VX and it worked really well--it has protected my handheld perfectly so far.;noturgent
very good product, well made.;noturgent
Mobile Phone Tools are a must have.;noturgent
I am very impressed with the job that Motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone.;noturgent
I received my orders well within the shipping timeframe, everything was in good working order and overall, I am very excited to have this source.;noturgent
The phone is sturdy and waterproof.;noturgent
I am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone.;noturgent
My only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5(of 5);noturgent
Thanks again to Amazon for having the things I need for a good price!;noturgent
I ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead.;noturgent
I had to go to a store and bought a new NOKIA phone which is working great.;noturgent
Works great!.;noturgent
REALLY UGLY.;noturgent
horrible, had to switch 3 times.;noturgent
The noise shield is incrediable.;noturgent
No real improvement.;noturgent
Razr Battery - Good buy.;noturgent
Keep up the good work Amazon!!;noturgent
They refuse to refund or replace.;noturgent
Unfortunately it's easy to accidentally activate them with the gentle-touch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening.;noturgent
So I basically threw my money out the window for nothing.;noturgent
Great case and price!;noturgent
All it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was cracked.I am not impressed and I am not laughing.;noturgent
Bluetooth range is good - a few days ago I left my phone in the trunk, got a call, and carried the conversation without a hitch.;noturgent
Small, sleek, impressive looking, practical setup with ample storage in place.;noturgent
The eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity.;noturgent
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly.;noturgent
I am glad I purchased it.;noturgent
I've missed numerous calls because of this reason.;noturgent
Perhaps my phone is defective, but people cannot hear me when I use this.;noturgent
Don't buy this product.;noturgent
sucked, most of the stuff does not work with my phone.;noturgent
No shifting, no bubbling, no peeling, not even a scratch, NOTHING!I couldn't be more happier with my new one for the Droid.;noturgent
Worst software ever used.... If I could give this zero stars I would.;noturgent
Trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration.;noturgent
The case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever.;noturgent
I own a Jabra Earset and was very happy with it, but the sound quality, especially outgoing, on this is better.;noturgent
I love the camera, it's really pretty good quality.;noturgent
Thank you for such great service.;noturgent
Its a total package.;noturgent
The seller is very understanding and patient, I would definitely buy from them again.;noturgent
"I give Wirefly 1 star.I will contact Cingular/AT&T; and inform them of this practice.";noturgent
It's AGGRAVATING!;noturgent
Great product for the price!.;noturgent
I have purchased these for both family and friends, and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use;noturgent
Virgin Wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone!;noturgent
None of it works, just don't buy it.;noturgent
Muddy, low quality sound, and the casing around the wire's insert was poorly super glued and slid off.;noturgent
Please dont waste your money.;noturgent
All in all, I'm quite satisfied with this purchase.;noturgent
If you are looking for a good quality Motorola Headset keep looking, this isn't it.;noturgent
Yet plantronics continues to use the same flawed charger design.;noturgent
Disapointing Results.;noturgent
Cumbersome design.;noturgent
Great it was new packaged nice works good, no problems and it came in less time then I expected!!!!;noturgent
Great Product.;noturgent
It's A PIECE OF CRAP!;noturgent
My experience was terrible..... This was my fourth bluetooth headset, and while it was much more comfortable than my last Jabra (which I HATED!!!;noturgent
This fixes all the problems.;noturgent
Worst ever.;noturgent
I am very happy;noturgent
I've had no trouble accessing the Internet, downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions.;noturgent
"I can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying ""what?""";noturgent
The battery life is highly unacceptable.;noturgent
That company is a joke.;noturgent
It does everything the description said it would.;noturgent
your service is so bad you have to close your agency;noturgent
Due to this happening on every call I was forced to stop using this headset.;noturgent
It works great with a car charger, especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time.;noturgent
Verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures, none of which worked and I ended up having to do a hard re-set, wiping out all my data.;noturgent
Voice Quality, Signal Strength, Dropped Calls.;noturgent
"It plays louder than any other speaker of this size; the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking, however, it's not.";noturgent
Better than expected.;noturgent
It feels poorly constructed, the menus are difficult to navigate, and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them.;noturgent
Battery is holding up well.;noturgent
Also difficult to put on.I'd recommend avoiding this product.;noturgent
I only used it two days, and it wasn't always easy to hear with.;noturgent
I got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was broken...I went to plug it in and it started smoking.;noturgent
Sprint - terrible customer service.;noturgent
Linked to my phone without effort.;noturgent
THey are so cool!;noturgent
Easy to use.;noturgent
Better Than New.;noturgent
What possesed me to get this junk, I have no idea...;noturgent
Piece of trash.;noturgent
A pretty good product.;noturgent
This is a great phone!.;noturgent
For the price on Amazon, it is an excellent product, which I would highly recommend.;noturgent
Their Research and Development division obviously knows what they're doing.;noturgent
The real killer is the volume, and of course it breaking.;noturgent
Those phones are working just fine now.;noturgent
I am more than happy with this product. 1;noturgent
Poor Construction.;noturgent
This is infuriating.;noturgent
Overall, I would recommend this phone over the new Walkman.;noturgent
Sprint charges for this service.;noturgent
It is cheap, and it feel and look just as cheap.;noturgent
It fits my ear well and is comfortable on.;noturgent
It doesn't work in Europe or Asia.;noturgent
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cent's up-and-coming.;noturgent
I like design and look of Jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortable to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear.;noturgent
I was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price.;noturgent
the worst phone from samsung...crap..... this crappy Samsung E715.. is the worst i have ever seeen.;noturgent
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone.;noturgent
Poor product.;noturgent
However I needed some better instructions.;noturgent
You need two hands to operate the screen.This software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs.;noturgent
Worked very well paired with a Treo 700w and as a Skype headset on my PC (using a USB Bluetooth transceiver).;noturgent
Steer clear of this product and go with the genuine Palm replacement pens, which come in a three-pack.;noturgent
DO NOT BUY DO NOT BUY IT SUCKS;noturgent
This is a great product..... sure beats using your fingers!.;noturgent
Plus, I seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point.;noturgent
All the other cases I've tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul.;noturgent
Very Dissapointing Performance.;noturgent
Don't make the same mistake that I did and please don't buy this phone.;noturgent
This phone might well be the worst I've ever had in any brand.;noturgent
Case was more or less an extra that I originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear.;noturgent
I recommend iGo to anyone with different brand cell phones/mp3 players in the family.;noturgent
Don't bother - go to the store.;noturgent
I posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone, but i have the Fire Red and it's a great color!;noturgent
I did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed.;noturgent
You get what you pay for I guess.;noturgent
Not only did the software do a great job of this, I could also make my own ringtones form my existing CDs without an internet connection.;noturgent
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and there's not much reviews about it.;noturgent
These are fabulous!;noturgent
However, BT headsets are currently not good for real time games like first-person shooters since the audio delay messes me up.;noturgent
I used bitpim (a free program you can find on the internet)to transfer data to the phone.The price of the cable was excellent.;noturgent
Disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer.;noturgent
Performed awful -- muffled, tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call.;noturgent
Very wind-resistant.;noturgent
Obviously they have a terrible customer service, so you get what you pay for.;noturgent
They do not last forever, but is not overly expensive to replace.Easy to operate and the sound is much better than others I have tried.;noturgent
I contacted the company and they told me that, although the unit was still under warranty, if I couldn't produce my receipt I was out of luck.;noturgent
Linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something!;noturgent
Phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are.;noturgent
Great phone.;noturgent
When I placed my treo into the case, not only was it NOT snug, but there was A LOT of extra room on the sides.;noturgent
I'm pleased.;noturgent
Battery is terrible.;noturgent
I found the product to be easy to set up and use.;noturgent
The earpiece on this is too large or too heavy...it keeps falling out of my ear.;noturgent
Utter crap.. Sound quality is TERRIBLE.;noturgent
The charger arrived within the promised timeframe, but it did not work.;noturgent
No ear loop needed, it's tiny and the sound is great.;noturgent
Finally, after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and I could not use it any longer on the visor.;noturgent
The handsfree part works fine, but then the car tries to download the address book, and the Treo reboots.Overall, I still rate this device high.;noturgent
Talk about USELESS customer service.;noturgent
"It felt too light and ""tinny."".";noturgent
This does not fit the Palm Tungsten E2 and it broke the first time I tried to plug it in.;noturgent
I'm happy about this purchase- good quality and low price.;noturgent
I love the look and feel of Samsung flip phones.;noturgent
Its well-designed and very sharp -- the blue is a very nice color.;noturgent
Does everything it should and more.;noturgent
I could not recommend these more.;noturgent
Nice Sound.;noturgent
Looks good in the picture, but this case was a huge disappointment!!;noturgent
Much less than the jawbone I was going to replace it with.;noturgent
Setup went very smoothly.;noturgent
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it.;noturgent
"A must study for anyone interested in the ""worst sins"" of industrial design.";noturgent
The first thing that happened was that the tracking was off.;noturgent
It is well made, easy to access the phone and has a handy, detachable belt clip.;noturgent
Then I had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping.;noturgent
Can't upload ringtones from a third party.;noturgent
Bluetooth does not work, phone locks up, screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked.;noturgent
Truly awful.;noturgent
It works fine on my Motorola 325 cellphone, and a lot better than the worn-out battery did.;noturgent
And none of the tones is acceptable.;noturgent
camera color balance is AWFUL.;noturgent
This product is clearly not ready for prime time, I don't care how cool it looks, if you can't tell a call is coming in it's worthless.;noturgent
I love the ringtones because they are so upbeat!;noturgent
Chinese Forgeries Abound!.;noturgent
Easy to pair with my Samsung Cell.;noturgent
The instructions didn't explain that a microphone jack could be used.;noturgent
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well.;noturgent
Too bad you have to pay up to $$$ a month for the service!;noturgent
Works well.;noturgent
The nokia CA-42 USB cable did not work with my phone.;noturgent
Clear crisp sound.;noturgent
I have to use the smallest earpieces provided, but it stays on pretty well.;noturgent
The biggest complaint I have is, the battery drains superfast.;noturgent
The design might be ergonomic in theory but I could not stand having these in my ear.;noturgent
Do NOT buy if you want to use the holster.;noturgent
The phone can also take great pictures and even video clips.;noturgent
It doesn't make you look cool.;noturgent
Because both ears are occupied, background is not distracting at all.;noturgent
Comfortable fit - you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time, if not for an entire day.;noturgent
Also, the phone doesn't seem to accept anything except CBR mp3s, preferably ripped by Windows Media Player.;noturgent
You can't beat the price on these.;noturgent
* Comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots, and even flash SOS signals (seriously!;noturgent
lightweight and works well.;noturgent
So just beware.;noturgent
I love this cable - it allows me to connect any mini-USB device to my PC.;noturgent
So anyone near you will hear part of your conversation.;noturgent
I bought this phone as a replacement for my StarTac and have regretted it since.;noturgent
Appears to actually outperform the original battery from China that came with my V325i.;noturgent
Can't store anything but phone numbers to SIM.;noturgent
It lasts less than 3o minutes, if I actually try to use the phone.My wife has the same phone with the same problem.;noturgent
Poor quality.;noturgent
"jabra ear gels ""R"" the best!.";noturgent
Not worth it.;noturgent
The phone crashed completely and now I have to get it replaced.;noturgent
It quit working after I'd used it for about 18 months, so I just purchased another one because this is the best headset I've ever owned.;noturgent
Unfortunately it will not recharge my iPhone 4s, despite connecting it from multiple power sources (iMac, external battery, wall outlet, etc).;noturgent
It was a great phone.;noturgent
if you simply want a small flip phone -- look elsewhere as the extra bells & whistles are mediocre.;noturgent
Good value, works fine - power via USB, car, or wall outlet.;noturgent
My phone doesn't slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand.;noturgent
This is simply the BEST bluetooth headset for sound quality!;noturgent
Think it over when you plan to own this one!This sure is the last MOTO phone for me!;noturgent
"In the span of an hour, I had two people exclaim ""Whoa - is that the new phone on TV?!?";noturgent
I have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful.;noturgent
This case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear, it is 100% functional.;noturgent
"Other than that, the leather is nice and soft; the fit is very tight; the cut out for the face is a good shape.";noturgent
It has everything I need and I couldn't ask for more.;noturgent
After receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke.;noturgent
This product is great... it makes working a lot easier I can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something.;noturgent
None of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears.;noturgent
T-Mobile has the best customer service anywhere.;noturgent
Arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold.;noturgent
We have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months.. Pros;noturgent
Provides good protection and looks classy, too.;noturgent
krusell Always good.;noturgent
The tracfone website is user friendly and makes it easy to activate, etc.;noturgent
The design is very good.4.;noturgent
I great reception all the time.;noturgent
I would highly recommend this product.;noturgent
Couldn't use the unit with sunglasses, not good in Texas!;noturgent
It dit not work most of the time with my Nokia 5320.;noturgent
Bought mainly for the charger, which broke soon after purchasing.;noturgent
If you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations, then this phone is for you!;noturgent
Fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is;noturgent
stay away from this store, be careful.;noturgent
This BlueAnt Super tooth hands-free phone speaker is AWESOME.;noturgent
Does not fit.;noturgent
.... Item arrived quickly and works great with my Metro PCS Samsung SCH-r450 slider phone and Sony Premium Sound in ear plugs.;noturgent
It is light, has plenty of battery capacity, and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time.;noturgent
disappointing.;noturgent
Blue Ant is easy to use.;noturgent
Cheap but hey it works.. Was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item.;noturgent
The camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors... I'd rather be using a disposable then this.;noturgent
Then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use.;noturgent
It's very convenient and simple to use - gets job done & makes the car ride so much smoother.;noturgent
The nano stated it.My son was dissapointed.;noturgent
The sound quality is excellent as well.;noturgent
Its the best headset I have used.;noturgent
Would not reccommend.;noturgent
They have been around for years and carries the highest quality of anti-glare screen protector that I have found to date.;noturgent
Just what I wanted.;noturgent
This particular model would not work with my Motorola Q smartphone.;noturgent
wont work right or atleast for me.;noturgent
"in addition it feels &amp; looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic.";noturgent
"But now that it is ""out of warranty"" the same problems recur.Bottom line... put your money somewhere else... Cingular will not support it.";noturgent
I really wanted the Plantronics 510 to be the right one, but it has too many issues for me.The good;noturgent
Great product.;noturgent
Crisp and Clear.;noturgent
AFter the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes.;noturgent
VERY cheap plastic, creaks like an old wooden floor.;noturgent
I get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment, where with other phones I have not had this problem.;noturgent
The reception has been generally good.;noturgent
Excellent sound, battery life and inconspicuous to boot!.;noturgent
Great bluetooth!.;noturgent
I highly recommend this case.;noturgent
WORTHWHILE.;noturgent
This is a great deal.;noturgent
After my phone got to be about a year old, it's been slowly breaking despite much care on my part.;noturgent
I am sorry I made this purchase.;noturgent
I bought these hoping I could make my Bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear.;noturgent
Treo and T-Mobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount.;noturgent
It was horrible!.;noturgent
They work about 2 weeks then break.;noturgent
I don't think it would hold it too securly on your belt.;noturgent
It is simple to use and I like it.;noturgent
It's a great tool for entertainment, communication, and data management.Oh, be sure to use ActiveSync 4.2 for optimal data synchronization results!;noturgent
I can't use this case because the smell is disgusting.;noturgent
NOT WHAT I WANTED.;noturgent
I own 2 of these cases and would order another.;noturgent
Great Phone.;noturgent
I bought this battery with a coupon from Amazon and I'm very happy with my purchase.;noturgent
The internet access was fine, it the rare instance that it worked.;noturgent
Perfect for the PS3.;noturgent
Five star Plus, plus.;noturgent
A good quality bargain.. I bought this after I bought a cheapy from Big Lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldn't hear me.;noturgent
$50 Down the drain.;noturgent
I tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and I was still told it wasn't great.;noturgent
Good , works fine.;noturgent
For the price this was a great deal.;noturgent
Great price, too!;noturgent
If there is a wind, it is completely useless.;noturgent
Yes it's shiny on front side - and I love it!;noturgent
Does Not Work.;noturgent
At first I thought I was grtting a good deal at $7.44, until I plugged it into my phone (V3c Razr).;noturgent
The reception through this headset is excellent.;noturgent
2 thumbs up to this seller;noturgent
I have a Verizon LG phone and they work well together, good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight.;noturgent
Improper description.... I had to return it.;noturgent
#1 It Works - #2 It is Comfortable.;noturgent
Battery charge-life is quite long.;noturgent
The Jabra EarGels fit my ears very well.;noturgent
Battery has no life.;noturgent
I checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing.;noturgent
Product is exactly as described.;noturgent
Gets a signal when other Verizon phones won't.;noturgent
Doesn't do the job.;noturgent
I would recommend it.;noturgent
Plan on ordering from them again and again.;noturgent
"That being said, for a phone, the camera is very nice; many cool effects to play with, and video is decent as well.";noturgent
I have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one.;noturgent
They keep getting better and better (this is my third one and I've had numerous Palms too).;noturgent
Awkward to use and unreliable.;noturgent
The shipping time was also very quick!;noturgent
Not as good as I had hoped.;noturgent
Good case!.;noturgent
Doesn't Work.;noturgent
Really good product.;noturgent
Unfortunately it did not work.;noturgent
All three broke within two months of use.;noturgent
dont buy it.;noturgent
My father has the V265, and the battery is dying.;noturgent
However, the ear pads come off easily and after only one week I lost one.;noturgent
The calls drop, the phone comes on and off at will, the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently.;noturgent
Horrible, horrible protector.;noturgent
I don't like this Nokia either.;noturgent
Reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable, and the send and end keys are not where I expect them to be.3.;noturgent
I have bought this Nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare.;noturgent
It would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with Amazon.;noturgent
the only VERY DISAPPOINTING thing was there was NO SPEAKERPHONE!!!!;noturgent
Terrible.. My car will not accept this cassette.;noturgent
Product is useless, since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones I was planning to use it with.;noturgent
It's not what it says it is.;noturgent
Stay Away From the Q!.;noturgent
Used and dirty.;noturgent
Very unreliable service from T-mobile !;noturgent
Not good enough for the price.;noturgent
I bought two of them and neither will charge.;noturgent
It looks very nice.;noturgent
This is an excellent tool, especially when paired with your phone's auto-answer.;noturgent
I have read other's reviews here but I haven't had any problem with it.;noturgent
These products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet.;noturgent
Comfortable in my hand.;noturgent
Just does not work.;noturgent
Poor Reliability.;noturgent
(It works!);noturgent
I have to fix my phone now for an urgent argument;urgent
If I take a picture, the battery drops a bar, and starts beeping, letting me know its dieing.;noturgent
Terrible product, and waste of money!;noturgent
Last time buying from you.;noturgent
It was a waste of my money.;noturgent
So far it has worked like a charm.;noturgent
I have only had it for a few weeks, but so far, so good.;noturgent
But, in any case, the best part is, you can download these pictures to your laptop using IR, or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone.;noturgent
Would recommend this item.;noturgent
"It's been my choice headset for years.Great sound; good volume; good noise cancellation.";noturgent
Nice case, feels good in your hands.;noturgent
The item received was Counterfeit.;noturgent
Just really good.. So far, probably the best BT headset I have ever had.;noturgent
Works fine.;noturgent
I received my headset in good time and was happy with it.;noturgent
I was very pleased to see that I could replace my well travled swivel holster for my Blackberry flip.;noturgent
My sister has one also and she loves it.;noturgent
Good Quality.;noturgent
This is by far the worst purchase I've made on Amazon.;noturgent
Excellent dual-purpose headset.;noturgent
Excellent!.;noturgent
Does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125.;noturgent
It seems completely secure, both holding on to my belt, and keeping the iPhone inside.;noturgent
The bottom line...another worthless, cheap gimmick from Sprint.;noturgent
Having trouble with volume.;noturgent
The only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears.;noturgent
WARNING - DO NOT BUY!!.;noturgent
I am pairing this with my iphone, and I could not be happier with it so far.;noturgent
When it opens, the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off.;noturgent
I didn't want the clip going over the top of my ear, causing discomfort.;noturgent
Best headset ever!!!.;noturgent
i need that very quickly!!;urgent
Don't trust their website and don't expect any helpful support.;noturgent
It was that loud.Glad to say that the Plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use.;noturgent
The speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap.;noturgent
Fits comfortably, came with three sizes of earbud tips.;noturgent
Excellent product for the price.;noturgent
Bad Reception.;noturgent
This product is very High quality Chinese CRAP!!!!!!;noturgent
It was quite comfortable in the ear.;noturgent
Great phone.;noturgent
Don't buy this product - It fails!.;noturgent
Everything about this product is wrong.First;noturgent
The pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before I started making calls with the voice dialing feature.;noturgent
This was utterly confusing at first, which caused me to lose a couple of very, very important contacts.;noturgent
Terrible phone holder.;noturgent
The cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly.;noturgent
I love being able to use one headset for both by land-line and cell.;noturgent
Problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily.;noturgent
Not nearly as good looking as the AMAZON picture makes it look.;noturgent
But despite these few flaws, this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official OEM product.;noturgent
How stupid is that?;noturgent
I can hear while I'm driving in the car, and usually don't even have to put it on it's loudest setting.;noturgent
Seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors.;noturgent
Good show, Samsung.;noturgent
So I bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money.;noturgent
It always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed.;noturgent
Couldn't figure it out;noturgent
My phone sounded OK ( not great - OK), but my wife's phone was almost totally unintelligible, she couldn't understand a word being said on it.;noturgent
So I had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it.;noturgent
While I managed to bend the leaf spring back in place, the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop.;noturgent
Leopard Print is wonderfully wild!.;noturgent
Works for me.;noturgent
Saggy, floppy piece of junk.;noturgent
much better than the hard plastic cases.;noturgent
It also had a new problem.;noturgent
Happy so far!.;noturgent
cool phone.;noturgent
Works good.;noturgent
Motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right.;noturgent
It looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two.;noturgent
but it is great, i would really recommend it;noturgent
Makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when I'm not wearing it.;noturgent
As I said above....PRETTY USELESS!;noturgent
Never got it!!!!!;noturgent
This pair of headphones is the worst that I have ever had sound-wise.;noturgent
[...] down the drain because of a weak snap!;noturgent
Does not charge the Cingular (ATT) 8525 phone.;noturgent
"You get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off.""";noturgent
However, after about a year, the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and I couldn't receive and place calls.;noturgent
I kept catching the cable on the seat and I had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off.;noturgent
The headset fulfills my requirements so I am happy with my purchase.;noturgent
Logitech Bluetooth Headset is a 10!.;noturgent
I like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear, rather than inside.;noturgent
A lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do I.;noturgent
I have tried these cables with my computer and my iPod and it works just fine.;noturgent
The mic there is a joke, and the volume is quite low.;noturgent
I'm returning them.;noturgent
I does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap.;noturgent
It is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable.;noturgent
I have had mine for about a year and this Christmas I bought some for the rest of the family.;noturgent
Otherwise, easy to install and use, clear sound.;noturgent
nice leather.;noturgent
I had to purchase a different case.;noturgent
It is a joy to use.;noturgent
Very much disappointed with this company.;noturgent
Very satisifed with that.;noturgent
It didn't charge for me.;noturgent
This is the phone to get for 2005.... I just bought my S710a and all I can say is WOW!;noturgent
Buttons are too small.;noturgent
Just reading on the specs alone makes you say WOW.;noturgent
Love it.. Great armband.;noturgent
I really like this product over the Motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic.;noturgent
However, the keypads are so tinny that I sometimes reach the wrong buttons.;noturgent
I exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and I'm pretty happy with that decision.;noturgent
I was very impressed with the price of the cases.;noturgent
Also makes it easier to hold on to.;noturgent
I use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment, and it works great!;noturgent
It's pretty easy.;noturgent
I cannot make calls at certain places.;noturgent
however, my girl was complain that some time the phone doesn't wake up like normal phone does.;noturgent
Beautiful styling though.;noturgent
This company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back.;noturgent
I'm trying to return it for a refund.;noturgent
I plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked.;noturgent
Excellent product.;noturgent
you have to fix up my phone quickly;urgent
Earbud piece breaks easily.;noturgent
Lousy product.;noturgent
This phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at it's very ability to be a phone.;noturgent
It is the best charger I have seen on the market yet.;noturgent
SWEETEST PHONE!!!;noturgent
:-)Oh, the charger seems to work fine.;noturgent
It fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal.;noturgent
Not enough volume.;noturgent
Echo Problem....Very unsatisfactory;noturgent
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor.;noturgent
don't waste your money.;noturgent
I am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product.;noturgent
Oh, the charger seems to work fine.;noturgent
